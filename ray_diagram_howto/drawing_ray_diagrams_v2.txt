Start from left side. Draw the following two rays until they hit the lens:
	-Ray 1_l: This wants to pass through both the tip of the object and the
		object focus, F_o.
	-Ray 2_l: This is parallel to the optical axis (OA) and wants to pass
		through the top of the object (were its direction not changed by the
		lens)

Now draw what emerges after the two rays pass through the lens:
	-Ray 1_r: This one always ends up parallel to the OA after passing through
		the lens, so draw a ray from Ray 1_l's intersection with the lens off to
		the right, parallel to the OA
	-Ray 2_r: The angle at which this ray deflects is determined by the image
		focus, F_i. So draw, from the lens and out to the right, a ray
		that *would* intersect F_i (if F_i is on the left side of the lens) or
		that *does* intersect F_i (if F_i is on the right side of the lens).

Now act as an observer far to the right of the lens. All you see is what
emerges from the right side of the lens, so just ignore everything to the left
of the lens. All you see, therefore, are the two rays emerging from the right
side of the lens.

At what common point does it appear that these two rays intersect? This point
delineates the image location and height.
